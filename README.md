App Brainstorming:
1. Discord - Messaging system, avatars and status updates, convenience of adding friends.
2. YouTube - Algorithm for recommending videos, adaptive for landscape and portrait mode, and channels/comments
3. Reddit - Threads, Thumbs up and down, changing avatars

An app I would like to build is a learning app for education use-cases. It is similar to YouTube, but perhaps more like Khan Academy.
